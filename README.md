# odw4

My solutions for the data challenge problems presented at the end of the workshop. 
Made a newer and more robust version of the Challenge4 solution. 
Now the code sifts through BH mass pairs from 10,10 --- 50,50 checking existence
of possible signals then filtering them out using chisquared treatment. Finally 
the code checks the surviving signals and determines whether they can be attributed 
to real, artificially injected or some other random source. The final classification 
is carried out on the basis of time difference between the surviving signals at 
Livingston and Hanford.
